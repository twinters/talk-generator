## [Unreleased]

<!-- Add changes here as you merge them; release.py moves them under the new version at release time. -->

## [4.0.0] - 2026-11-05

First release published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/talkgenerator/)
(`pip install talkgenerator`). This is the modernized, still pre-LLM version of the
generator described in the EvoMUSART 2019 paper: the same approach, brought up to date.

### Added

- New image and content sources: Openverse, Wikimedia Commons, the Art Institute of
  Chicago, GIPHY and Wikiquote. Image credits on the slides link back to the source.
- On-disk caching of search API responses (Datamuse, ConceptNet, Pixabay, Pexels,
  Unsplash), which keeps runs within each API's rate limits. Configurable with
  `TALKGENERATOR_CACHE_DIR` and `DISABLE_CACHE`.
- `.env.example`, and a `DISABLE_<SOURCE>` switch for every source.
- Unsplash photo credits ("Photo by &lt;photographer&gt; on Unsplash"), linking both the
  photographer and Unsplash as the API terms require.
- Gradual type checking with mypy, and a weekly "canary" workflow that runs the network
  tests against the live APIs and opens an issue when a source breaks.

### Changed

- Packaging moved to `pyproject.toml` and uv; CircleCI replaced by GitHub Actions.
- Publishing to PyPI through trusted publishing, so no API tokens are stored anywhere.
- Requires Python 3.11+ and Pillow 13 (which closes ~40 known vulnerabilities); the
  image formats the generator accepts are now restricted.
- Schema modules rewritten from star-imports into explicit registries.
- Openverse is used mostly as a fallback photo source, and is searched as a registered
  app when its credentials are set.
- The `ted` schema stays closer to the requested topic.
- Generation details are kept out of the speaker notes by default (`--debug_notes` to
  include them).

### Fixed

- Dead content sources and holes in generated decks.
- A slide whose images don't come through is now replaced by another slide, instead of
  leaving a hole.
- Reddit posts that link to Imgur now load the image from Reddit's own copy.
- ConceptNet failures fall back to Datamuse and WordNet instead of erroring.

### Dependencies

- Bumped black, requests, pytest, python-dotenv, lxml, marshmallow, urllib3, idna,
  soupsieve and pillow to current versions.
